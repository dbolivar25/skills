# TypeSafe as a selected vendor

Read this reference when TypeSafe is explicitly selected, already present in the target system, or is being assessed as a concrete candidate. It does not recommend a default provider. Begin with the actual inference contract and repository seam in AI Engineering, then compare the selected vendor's current behavior, API and cost against that need.

The retained TypeSafe method treats focused typed judgments as programming primitives while code owns exact rules, workflow control and effects. Its examples describe the source material's System One/Jev approach. The primary index, question semantics, state, confidence, fan-out and JavaScript SDK entry points were checked against official docs on 2026-10-06. This is a dated documentation observation, not an installed integration test. Check names, API semantics, model availability, probabilities and performance against current official docs and the installed SDK before execution. Do not transplant cookbook thresholds into a new domain without evaluation.

## Read the live docs

**The live TypeSafe docs are the source of truth. Read them as part of the task.**
This selected-vendor reference carries design patterns; the docs carry current concepts, prompting guidance,
API contracts, SDK usage, models, limits, and worked examples.

- Start with the [documentation index](https://docs.typesafe.ai/llms.txt) to discover
  relevant pages and cookbooks. Use targeted reads rather than loading the entire site.
- Follow current links from the index and resolve relative links against `https://docs.typesafe.ai`. Try the normal page if a Markdown view fails; a fetch format is not an API contract.
- Before writing an integration, read the current API or chosen SDK page and the
  question guidance relevant to the design. For a new workflow, also inspect the
  closest cookbook: it often shows a better decomposition than a generic classifier.
- If the index is unavailable, use the direct links below or the site's navigation.
  If Markdown fetching fails, try the normal page. If live access is unavailable,
  use available local docs or installed SDK types, state that limitation, and avoid
  inventing version-dependent details.

## Find the useful shape

Start from the behavior the user wants: what will the application show, select,
change, or hand off? Work backward to the judgments it needs. Keep known rules,
calculations, exact lookups, and execution in code. Preserve the user's chosen stack and scope. Use TypeSafe only for the selected integration; compare its actual benefit against the existing seam and simpler alternatives when that choice remains open.

When brainstorming or choosing an architecture, consider more than classification.
The patterns below are starting points: combine primitives around the user's goal,
including ideas that do not fit an established recipe.

- **Route and fill known arguments.** A request can select a handler and its typed
  parameters. Ask useful branch-specific questions up front and consume only the
  relevant answers. Explore [function calling](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/function_calling)
  and [speculative fan-out](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/fan-out).
- **Select instead of generate.** Find candidate values or source spans in code,
  use a judgment to select the intended one, then copy or normalize it. Code can
  also assemble source text into a formatted document or reading guide. Explore
  [value extraction](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/pre_parsed_value_extraction_cookbook)
  and [structure recovery](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/autoformat).
- **Find and judge evidence.** Retrieve candidates, compare their relevance to a
  query, and select useful context. Explore [reranking](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/rerank_typesafe)
  and [hierarchical classification](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/hierarchical_classification).
- **Turn judgments into reusable data.** Score dimensions once, then let code or
  user controls change weights, thresholds, rankings, and views. With labeled
  outcomes, those signals can become classical ML features. Explore
  [composite scoring](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/composite-scoring) and
  [feature discovery](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/autoresearch_feature_discovery).
- **Verify and escalate.** Check specific claims or fields against their evidence;
  send uncertain or failing cases to a person or reasoning model. Explore
  [citation checks](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/citation_check) and
  [extraction cascades](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/sde_cascade).
- **Respond to changing state.** Code can retain goals and observations while fresh
  judgments guide the next bounded step. Keep inferred state distinct from observed
  facts, and check freshness before applying a result to a changed situation.

For open-ended requests, offer the few directions that best serve the user's goal
and recommend a starting point. For a concrete authorized implementation, choose the relevant pattern and build. A design or assessment returns the proposal and evidence needs; a brainstorm is not a mandatory detour.

## Design the judgments

The dated official [question reference](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives) distinguishes the following primitives. Verify current names and semantics against installed types before using them; choose by what the answer means:

| Need | Primitive | Important distinction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One of a defined set | [Choice](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/choice) | Picks one option; its distribution compares competing options |
| Whether a condition holds | [Noul](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/noul) | Probability of yes; no separate confidence; use one per label when several may apply |
| Degree along a described dimension | [Score](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/score) | Probability-weighted position on ordered levels; use comparable per-item Scores for graded ranking |

Give each question enough relevant **state** to answer: source text, identities,
relationships, policies, and current facts. Prefer named JSON fields when context
has several parts. Put the judgment in **instructions** and define its possible
answers in **criteria**. Question IDs are for code and are not sent to the model;
include complete meaning in the question. Reference nested state with backticked
paths such as `ticket.messages[0].text`.

Ask one narrow, coherent judgment per question. Split independently useful dimensions,
without destroying the relationship being judged. A bounded action selection or
contextual interpretation is valid; atomic does not mean literal fact extraction
or a one-sentence limit. Strings work for simple questions. Use structured objects
or arrays when definitions, contrasts, exclusions, or examples clarify instructions
or criteria. Score levels must describe concrete situations and stand on their own.

Keep the needed answers available. Include a no-match outcome when nothing may fit;
use a separate presence judgment when it is independently useful. For source-value
selection, check candidate coverage: the model cannot choose an omitted value.

## Compose and verify

When the current provider supports it, **batch independent questions over the same state**, including useful speculative questions whose possible value earns their cost. They run in parallel and cannot see one another's answers.
State each speculative premise explicitly; code consumes the applicable answers.
A second request is warranted when an earlier answer is needed to fetch evidence,
construct new state, or determine the next options. Extra questions still use tokens;
measure actual request budgets, cost, and end-to-end latency.

Use probabilities and confidence to guide behavior, with thresholds evaluated on
the user's data and consequences. The official [confidence reference](https://docs.typesafe.ai/confidence) describes Choice/Score confidence as a statistic of the answer distribution. It does not establish overall workflow correctness, empirical calibration in this domain or permission to act. A Noul near
0.5 means similar probability for yes and no, not medium intensity. Several
acceptable alternatives can also spread probability; low confidence need not
invalidate a harmless preference choice. Ignore uncertainty on unused branches.

Keep policy explicit and judgments scoped to their evidence, meaning and consumers. Reuse within a known contract; durable semantic reuse requires the [promotion method](../references/derivation/durable-state-and-promotion.md). Weighted scores suit compensating
preferences; an “any serious violation” rule needs separate conditions. Changing a
weight or display filter need not rerun inference when evidence and question meanings
are unchanged. A typed answer establishes its response shape, not truth, candidate coverage, support or authorized consumer behavior. Validate calibration and performance in the target domain; a vendor claim or typed result does not establish them.

Test representative cases and the resulting application behavior. For failures,
inspect the exact state, questions, candidates, answers, composition, and observed
outcome. Separate missing evidence, model errors, code errors, and service failures.
Treat cookbook thresholds and demo results as examples to evaluate, not universal
rules or permanent model limitations. Keep API credentials server-side in web apps.
